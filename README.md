# Arduino-Console-Interface
<h2>What is this?</h2>
This repository contains the library to be used when developing games/applications to be used on my <a href="https://github.com/leviaviv28/Arduino-Console-Firmware"> Arduino Based Game Console </a>

<h2>Current Features</h2>
Currently this library contains utility functions to allow programs to send graphical data to the console, as well as receive input data from the console.

<h2>What to expect next?</h2>
I am in the process of developing a system to allow sound effects or music to be sent to the console
